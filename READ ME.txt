About the project

1. There is no 3rd party software with the project.
2. The project did not use any database. The data stor in files, the user infomation is stored in file 'user.txt', the transaction records are stored in file 'user_record.txt'.
3. I don't how to make "The caller will supply a transaction id", so I just made the service provide radom transaction id.


Instruction of service & API design

1. Run 'ServerMain.java' to start the server then run 'ClientMain.java', and you can see the GUI of the service. 
2. Login as user by username,password="123,123". There are 3 buttons 'Record', 'Debit', 'Credit' and a label 'Balance'.
3. 'Record' is used to display transaction records, 'Debit' is used to register debit transactions, 'Credit' is used to register credit transactions. 'Balance' is used to display current balance of user.
